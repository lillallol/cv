				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>
					I have been studying front end development for the last two years on
					my own. I have no working experience in the field.

				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lillallol/outline-pdf"
								>outline-pdf</a
							>
							| ts, ts-jest, BDD, cspell, eslint, pdf-lib
							<br />
							A module I published to npm that adds outline to an outline-less
							pdf. Has high level API and can make parts of the outline to be
							collapsed by default. I had to read the pdf specification to
							create this module.
							<br />
							Uses pdf-lib, which is a fast to download npm module that deals
							with low level manipulation of pdf and works in both browser and
							nodejs.
							<br />
							As far as I have searched there is no other module in the npm
							registry that has the same characteristics.
						</p>
					</li>
					<!--
						<li>
						DIC: My own dependency injection container created from scratch and
						used in my projects| TS, Jest, BDD
						<ul>
							<li>
								Components registered are functions that act like factories.
							</li>
							<li>
								Option for transient or singleton lifecycle when registering
								components.
							</li>
							<li>
								Option for clearing memoization table for components with
								singleton lifecycle (useful in tests where singletons act as
								state).
							</li>
							<li>
								Registration of component dependencies has to be done manually.
							</li>
							<li>Option for decorating advices when registering observers.</li>
							<li>
								Option for providing specific dependencies when requiring a
								component.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						M of MVC: My own reactive model created from scratch and used in my
						MVC framework| TS, Jest, BDD, SOLID, DIC
						<ul>
							<li>observable single source of truth as state</li>
							<li>built in undo redo functionality</li>
							<li>state mutated only through actions</li>
							<li>
								transactional-ity when informing observers about state changes
							</li>
							<li>heavily inspired from mobx library</li>
							<li>
								ability to choose which actions will be recorded for undo redo
							</li>
							<li>state diffing</li>
							<li>
								ability to undo redo a set of actions as a whole with the usage
								of action children
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						documentation-to-pdf: A nodejs script that uses puppeteer to automate as much as
						possible the creation of an indexed pdf from website
						documentations.| TS, JEST, BDD, SOLID, DIC, puppeteer, nodejs
						<ul>
							<li>
								it offers an automatic way to extract the index of the pdf from
								the navigation element of the documentation with some extra
								options.
							</li>
							<li>
								it offers many options on how each dom element will be converted
								to pdf (scroll to trigger lazy-loading images, disable max width
								and height etc.).
							</li>
							<li>
								it has worked for the documentations found in the websites of :
								Jest, webpack, mobx, react, typescript, vue, redux,
								javascript.info, htmldog, prettier, lit-html, lit-element,
								react-redux, preact, rxjs, babel, parcel, visual studio code,
								cypress, npmjs, express.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						MVC : An MVC framework created from scratch using lit-html for
						rendering| TS, JEST, BDD, SOLID, DIC
						<ul>
							<li>state persistence</li>
						</ul>
